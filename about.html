## About

Hi! My name is Tomas Sykora. I was born and raised in the heart of Europe in beatiful Prague Czech republic.
At early age of 16 I was signed as professional baseball player by Cincinnati Reds, unfortunately, maybe thankfuly 
I was released after I dislocated my throwing shoulder, considering that I used to be pitcher it was pretty 
much the end of my career. Why thankfuly? That's because I was able to go to Czech Technical University, 
where I study Software Engineering and now I love building software way more that I ever loved to play ball.
